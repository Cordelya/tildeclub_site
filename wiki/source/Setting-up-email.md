title: setting up email
---

Your shiny, new tilde.club account comes with an email account you can use only between tilde.club members. `pine`  is a command-line email application to use it, as is `mutt`. Good old-fashioned `mail` works too, although it's a little cryptic.

`pine` is menu driven, and the menus are self-explanatory; it's surprisingly easy to learn, and surprisingly powerful when you want to customize it.

From the command line (after logged in via SSH), type: `pine` and `[return]`
Follow instructions and use the menus at the bottom and top. (Note: When you see the ^ in front of the letter it means you need to use CTRL, otherwise just use the letter.)
