`screen` is a unix utility that lets you manage multiple shells from within a single window. You switch between them with a few keystrokes. When you disconnect it keeps the processes alive, and you can reconnect from another login.

It's pretty handy. [[tmux]] does a similar set of things.

a nice [screen tutorial](http://tilde.club/~jonathan/screen/) from ~jonathan will walk you through it.
