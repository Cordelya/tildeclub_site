## this is out of date and the netnews server is down

We're working on it. You'll need a news server to read news, and it's up; 
it's `news.tilde.club`.

[slrn](slrn.html) is a newsreader; see http://slrn.sourceforge.net/ for details.

[[pine]] can read news; this
[http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/Help/News/PineNews.html](tutorial) might help.
You can also read the [FAQ from U Washington](http://www.washington.edu/pine/faq/news.html).

In Pine do 'S' for setup, 'C' for config, then 
set 'NNTP Server (for news)' to news.tilde.club
Then go back to the main menu, and pick Folder List,
A for add, ^t for list

`M-x gnus` in [[emacs]] can read news, but you better know [[emacs]] first before you start.

[[lynx]] reads news, a la `lynx news://news.tilde.club/tilde.general`. It can even post news, but you have to design your own headers.

There is also [tin](tin.html).
