tin is a threaded NNTP and spool based UseNet newsreader for a variety of platforms.

http://www.tin.org/

it's under active development, with a last release on October 3, 2014. It is installed on ``tilde.club``, and should be invoked as `tin -r` to read from the remote news spool. Use <tab> to go to the next unread article and `w` to write a new article.

if you have `tin` on your local box and can do [[ssh port forwarding]], you can read news using it. (details forthcoming).
