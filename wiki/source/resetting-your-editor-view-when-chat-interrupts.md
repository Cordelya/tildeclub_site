title: Resetting your editor view when chat interrupts
---

You may have been caught off guard while editing and had some random chat messages muss up your view. It didn't actually edit your HTML page but you need to reset your editor view.

`CTRL+L` will reset your view

`mesg n` at the command prompt will turn off chat messages in that window.

If you don't ever want to see wall messages on your screen, put `mesg n`
into your startup file (details of how to do that needed here).
