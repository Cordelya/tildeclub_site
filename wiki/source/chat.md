Back on the command line, you may want to participate in chat. There is some great chat, likely, or you have questions.

Type: `wall` and `[return]` to tell Terminal you are ready to chat
Type your message to the world and `[return]`
`CTRL+D` to post or `CTRL+C` to change your mind and cancel
Have fun!

If you're tired of reading chats in a window, `mesg n` will turn it off, and `mesg y` will
turn it back on again. And if you want to see more people, look for IRC.
